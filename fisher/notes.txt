Notes from Anya (BUT)

The transcriptions are in SNOR format (mono-case text with no syntactic punctuation)

LDC automatically segmented the speech and then the transcriber had to type in the words for each segment.  
When the transcriber wasn't sure, he could try to guess and put it to double parentheses, or he could leave them empty.

In the case of BBN, the transcriber heard the whole conversation and transcribed it. 
Then, ASR was used to align the transcription text and audio and assign time steps for individual utterances. 
Double parentheses were not used by transcribers at all, rather they were added on the ASR alignment stage if 
the manual and automatic transcriptions differed significantly.

2. contractions are used (i'm, aren't, there's)
3. e.g., L.A. (Los Angeles) is transcribed as: l._a. 
4. word part followed by "-", e.g., par- , is this for incomplete words?
5. (( )) unclear utterance
6. (( text )) best estimate by transcriber
7.
8. [type of noice] for noises such as laughter
9. uh-huh also seen as uh huh, mm-hum, huh-huh
